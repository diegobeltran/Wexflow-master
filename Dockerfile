# Instructions below translated from
# https://github.com/aelassas/Wexflow/wiki/Installation:

# Tell Docker to use this as the base run directory for image:
# (replaces original 'cd' command in Wexflow installation)
WORKDIR /opt/wexflow/Wexflow.Server

# Modification of installation instructions so that
# Docker exposes the wexflow server once itâ€™s run:
EXPOSE 8000
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Wexflow.Server.dll"]
